Project Structure and File Summaries
Here is a brief summary of each file in the project structure:

database.py
This file sets up the database connection using SQLAlchemy, creates a database session using a thread-local variable, and defines a Base object that serves as the base for all database models.

models.py
This file defines the Notice model using SQLAlchemy. The model includes the id, title, content, created_at, updated_at, and user_email fields.

schemas.py
This file defines the Pydantic schemas for the Notice model. The NoticeCreate schema includes all required fields except for the id and timestamps, while the NoticeUpdate schema includes all fields except for the id and timestamps.

crud.py
This file defines the CRUD operations for the Notice model. The functions include get_notice() to retrieve a single notice by ID, get_notices() to retrieve a list of notices, create_notice() to create a new notice, update_notice() to update an existing notice, and delete_notice() to delete a notice by ID.

main.py
This file sets up the FastAPI application and defines endpoints for the Notice Board API using the functions defined in crud.py. The endpoints include /notices/ to create a new notice and retrieve all notices, and /notices/{notice_id} to retrieve, update, or delete a notice by its ID. The file also includes a get_db() function that creates a database session dependency for the endpoints.
